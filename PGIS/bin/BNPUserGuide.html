    <h1>How to Use the Bits 'N' Pieces Parts Catalog</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Bits 'N' Pieces User Guide for the Parts Catalog!  The Parts Catalog allows you to store all kinds of products and retrieve them as you so desire.  What's special about the Bits 'N' Pieces Parts Catalog is that there's no need to hire a DBA.  Using complex, internal, magical powers, the Bits 'N' Pieces Parts Catalog takes your data and carefully organizes it into an XML file.  You might be asking yourself the following question: "Why would anyone use XML to store parts information?" and the answer to that is "Because it's AWESOME!!"  Think about it, why spend an eternity maintaining a database when you can simply store the same data in a file.  Granted we wouldn't want to use this particular technique for exceptionally large amounts of data, but for personal usage or small sets of information, this works fantastic!<br /><br />

        So without further ado, let's get to the meat 'n' potatoes of the application.  That's right, feast your eyes on this bad boy:<br />

        <div class="image">
          <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog.jpg" />
        </div>
    </p>
   
    <p>
        Okay let's dig in shall we?
    </p>
  
    <h3>1. Adding a Record:</h3>
    
    <p>
        To add a record to the XML file, simply click the Add button at the bottom of the window and you'll be on your way to capturing valuable data in no time.  See the image below for further guidance on this process:
    </p>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Add.jpg" />
    </div><br>
  
    <h3>2. Saving a Record:</h3>
  
    <p>
        Once you've added a record and carefully entered your data, crazy internal magic will begin to happen upon pressing the Save button.  I should have renamed the Save button to "Presto" in order to elaborate on this notion.  See the pictures below for guidance:
    </p>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_DataEntry.jpg" />
    </div><br>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Save.jpg" />
    </div>
  
    <p>
        Feel free to enter more data at your leisure.  Data can be captured through the grid interface or the text boxes.  So enter the data as you see fit.  Just try not to break anything as this is a delicate work of art and still within it's early stages of life.
    </p>
  
    <h3>3. Removing a Record:</h3>
  
    <p>
        If for some reason you feel the need to remove data that you no longer like, almost as if you were unfriending it, then go right ahead.  The data is strong, it won't cry.  To perform this difficult task, please glance over the images below:
    </p>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Remove1.jpg" />
    </div><br>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Remove2.jpg" />
    </div><br>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Remove3.jpg" />
    </div><br>
  
   <h3>4. Searching for a Record:</h3>
  
    <p>
        Searching for data is easier than ever with our patented search feature.  Simply type your search criteria into the available field, press the Search button, and "PRESTO!"...I said "Presto!"..."?"...Oh, that's right, be sure to type your search criteria into the field exactly as it is portrayed in the data, otherwise even magic won't be able to locate what you're looking for.  See the images below for more details:
    </p>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Search1.jpg" />
    </div><br>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Search2.jpg" />
    </div><br>
  
    <h3>5. Expired Products:</h3>
  
    <p>
        Some products claim to be guaranteed for life while others have an expiration date.  Good thing the Bits 'N' Pieces Parts Catalog comes equipped with its very own Expire-o-meter.  As soon as you launch the application, the Expire-o-meter kicks into action and counts the products that have expired.  If there are products that have exceeded their expiration date, the Bits 'N' Pieces Parts Catalog will tell you how many parts are no longer considered worthy of your needs.  Example images are available below for your viewing pleasure:
    </p>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Expired1.jpg" />
    </div><br>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Expired2.jpg" />
    </div><br>
  
    <h3>6. Exiting the Application:</h3>
  
    <p>
        When you've completed your efforts for the day and have captured as much data as humanly possible, you may want to exit the application.  To do this, follow the example shown below:  Careful, this one's a bit tricky.
    </p>
  
    <div class="image">
      <img src="Images\BNPPartsCatalog_Exit.jpg" />
    </div><br>
